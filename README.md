# ‚ú® Write CSS with Confidence ‚Äî No More Guesswork!

Hey there üëã

Let me ask you something ‚Äî have you ever written CSS and thought:

> _"Why isn‚Äôt this working?"_  
> _"Why is this element behaving like this?"_  
> _"Why does adding one line break everything else?"_

If you nodded ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äî you‚Äôre not alone.  
In fact, I‚Äôve been exactly where you are. That‚Äôs why I created this repo.
> I‚Äôm learning new things every day ‚Äî It‚Äôs not just a static collection ‚Äî it‚Äôs a growing learning log.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why this repo?

I‚Äôve spent way too much time stuck in the trial-and-error loop while writing CSS ‚Äî guessing, googling, tweaking, refreshing, breaking things, and repeating it all again.

At some point, I realized: the problem wasn‚Äôt CSS... the problem was **not having a rock-solid understanding of the fundamentals**.

So I decided to do something about it.

This repo is my personal journey of learning CSS the right way ‚Äî **from the ground up**. Every note, every example, every explanation here is something I‚Äôve explored, understood (or struggled with!), and documented with chatGPT for my **own future reference**.

And I thought ‚Äî why not share it with you too?
